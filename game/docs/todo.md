# Ideas & To Dos

* Rearrange sprite into two variant packs then we can do the variant check once per pack draw cycle
* Keep track of bottom left and then we can do collision detection based on pixel hit + relative position.
* Where we have case statements like _adjust_alien_pack_direction, could we get a speed increase via an index into a jump table?
